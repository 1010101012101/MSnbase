TODO for Package MSnbase    -*- mode: org; -*-

* Documentation [0/1]
  - [ ] MSnProcess-class.Rd: add links to the cleaning, peak removing 
	and merging methods/functions in the documentation.
  - [ ] readMzXMLMData.Rd: add links to removePeaks and clean methods 
	once documented.
* Bugs [1/3]
 - [ ] check header function
 - [ ] quantification: intensities that do not start/end with 0, which leads to errors in getCurveWidth (while (ylwr!=0) line)
 - [X] MSnProcess slot MSnbaseVersion is of length 13?

* Code [5/5]
 - [ ] add curveData collection to quantify method.
 - [X] MSnQual class in DataClasses.R: add metadata (eSet slots)
       MOVED qual slot to MSnSet.
 - [X] Create reporterNames accessors and setter for ReporterIons.
 - [X] When generating MSnSet with quantify from MSnExp, make sure that 
       precursor's MZ, and possibly some other data from the spectra
       is stored in featureData.
 - [X] Issue with assayData slot when MSnSet is created in quantify.MSnExp 
       (see R CMD check).
 - [X] Fix example(MSnSet): Error in validObject(.Object).
