TODO for Package MSnbase    -*- mode: org; -*-

* Documentation [2/2]
  - [X] MSnProcess-class.Rd: add links to the cleaning, peak removing 
	and merging methods/functions in the documentation.
  - [X] readMzXMLMData.Rd: add links to removePeaks and clean methods 
	once documented.
* Bugs [3/3]
 - [X] check header function
 - [X] quantification: intensities that do not start/end with 0, 
       which leads to errors in getCurveWidth (while (ylwr!=0) line) 
       (see Velos data for instance). This has been fixed, but another 
       error in utils:::area:
       Error in if (min(y) != 0) { : missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed
 - [X] MSnProcess slot MSnbaseVersion is of length 13?

* Code [7/8]
 - [ ] Add xlim paramter to plotting methods (reuse reporters=zoom())
 - [X] Export documented MSnExp methods
 - [ ] automate ReporterIons data serialization.
 - [X] add curveData collection to quantify method.
 - [X] MSnQual class in DataClasses.R: add metadata (eSet slots)
       MOVED qual slot to MSnSet.
 - [X] Create reporterNames accessors and setter for ReporterIons.
 - [X] When generating MSnSet with quantify from MSnExp, make sure that 
       precursor's MZ, and possibly some other data from the spectra
       is stored in featureData.
 - [X] Issue with assayData slot when MSnSet is created in quantify.MSnExp 
       (see R CMD check).
 - [X] Fix example(MSnSet): Error in validObject(.Object).
